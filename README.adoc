This is a replacement for the VAXstation 3100 SCSI Terminator.  The 68-pin
connector is SCSI-1 SE with a {url-vs3100-scsi}[proprietary pinout], _not_
wide SCSI!  Your only options are to buy an original SCSI Terminator (DEC P/N
12-29635-01) or to make your own.

Assembly

Just solder on the parts, but make sure to get their orientation right!  Check
